Where to Star Gaze is a website for finding places to gaze into the infinite abyss of space. It uses NASA data on light pollution,
compiled and processed by the Earth Observation Group at the Colorado School of Mines, tree density data from the US forest service,
and live cloud coverage from OpenWeather to find you the best places to stargaze near you.

For each suggested location, you can find visible planets, constellations, and other cool views. If you know a spot that you'd like to share,
you can add it for everyone to see!

Always know a spot with [wheretostargaze.us](https://www.wheretostargaze.us)!
